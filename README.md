# KızlarSoruyor Demo
This project is a web application built using Vue 3, Vite, Bootstrap, and Vee-Validate. The goal of this project is to provide a high-performance, user-friendly experience utilizing modern web development techniques and tools.




## Technologies Used

### Vue 3

Vue 3 is a flexible and performance-oriented modern JavaScript framework. This project uses Vue 3’s Composition API and reactive properties to create more manageable and scalable components.

### Vite

Vite is a build tool that significantly speeds up development and is optimized for modern JavaScript applications. We chose Vite for its fast startup time and hot module replacement (HMR) capabilities, which make the development process more efficient.

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is used to create responsive and mobile-friendly web pages. By using Bootstrap in this project, we leveraged pre-defined style components and grid systems to develop a fast and consistent user interface.

### Vee-Validate

Vee-Validate simplifies and manages form validation effectively. In this project, Vee-Validate is used to ensure that the data collected from users is accurate and valid, enhancing user experience and easing error management.
